# PrivacyPlus
 PrivacyPlus is a Neos mod that hides your Discord and Steam IDs from other users in a session.
 Additionally it also randomizes your hashed unique device identifier.

## The Unique Device Identifier
 The unique device identifier is a value that is meant to uniquely identify your computer.
 By default, Neos sends a hashed version of this value to users in sessions you connect to and to the Neos servers.
 This mod automatically randomizes the hash that is sent to other users every time you start up Neos but it does not modifier the value sent to Neos' servers.
