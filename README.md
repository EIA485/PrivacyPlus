# PrivacyPlus
 PrivacyPlus is a Neos mod that hides your Discord and Steam IDs from other users in a session.  
 Note:  
 The basegame already does this to an extent, but it still sends a hashed version of them to others.
 
 Additionally it also randomizes your hashed unique device identifier.  
 If you want to re-randomize or customize this, you can do so in the settings.  
 Resetting it to default will re-randomize it.
